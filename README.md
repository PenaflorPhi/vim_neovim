# My (Neo)Vim configuration.
I love both Vim and Neovim and need to use both on a daily basis, I'm trying to keep them as similar as possible.

## Dependencies
### Both
xsel

### vim

### Neovim

## vim
The structure of this vim directory is pretty standard. 

```
├── autoload/       # Scripts that are loaded on-demand
├── colors/         # Color scheme files
├── plugin/         # Plugin-specific configurations
├── after/          # Configurations loaded after the default ones
├── ftplugin/       # Filetype-specific configurations
├── vimrc           # Main configuration file
```

## neovim
